Implemented an image processing project focusing on RGB image manipulation, featuring operations such as
Mirroring, Grayscale conversion and Sharpness filtering.
Employed a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture to manage the sequential application of image transformations
and transitions between processing stages.
